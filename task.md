### Backend Challenge – Game Engine with User Simulator 

Objective: 
Build a Go-based backend system that simulates multiple users answering a game question, evaluates responses in real-time, and announces a winner. 


Requirements: 

You must build three components: 

1. Mock User Engine 

- Accepts an input N (e.g., 1000 users). 
    - For each user, randomly: 
    - Assigns a correct answer flag (yes/no). 
    - Adds a random delay (10–1000ms) to simulate network lag. 
- Sends all responses concurrently to the API server. 

2. API Server 
- Exposes an endpoint /submit to receive user responses (JSON format). 
- Forwards each response to the Game Engine for evaluation. 

3. Game Engine 
- Determines the first user who sent a correct answer. 
- Prints the winner's user ID on the server console. 
- Ignores all subsequent correct responses once a winner is found. 

## Constraints & Evaluation: 

Language: Must use Go. 

- The server must handle 1000 concurrent requests without race conditions or deadlocks. 

- Responses should be evaluated in real-time (no batching). 

Code must demonstrate: 
    - Concurrency handling (goroutines, mutexes, channels, or atomic operations). 
    - Clean structure (separate files/modules for Mock User Engine, API, and Game Engine). 
    - Correctness under load (only one winner is declared). 

## Bonus Points: 

- Add metrics to track how many correct/incorrect answers were received. 
- Print the time taken to find the winner. 
- Use channels instead of only mutexes for event-driven response handling.
